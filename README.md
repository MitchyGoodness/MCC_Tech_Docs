# MCC Tech Documentation

Documentation of the AV system used by Multiply Christian Church to host a service and stream it live to social media.

## Updating this Documentation

Research Markdown syntax to learn how to modify files such as this `README.md` file.
Navigate to [draw.io](https://draw.io) to modify `*.drawio` files such as the main diagram.
Export the modified diagram to an image format and link to it in the `README.md` to update it here.

## MacBook

The MacBook has 4 USB-C ports and one 3.5mm audio jack for TRS (tip ring sleeve) connections.
These ports are used for two HDMI outputs, one HDMI input, one audio output, and the power brick to charge the MacBook.

### First HDMI output

  This is for the raw, unmodified output.
  It is displayed on the side stage TVs and can be used as slides on the live stream.
  It’s fed into the HDMI splitter (mounted at the bottom of the audio cart) via a flat HDMI cable labeled “Computer”.
  That same feed is returned from the audio cart via a flat HDMI cable, which is labeled “RESI”.
  Plug it into either INPUT 7 or INPUT 8.

#### Second HDMI output 

  This is for song lyrics.
  It is often called “lower-third” since the content is aligned to the bottom and limited to the lower third of the screen.
  It feeds directly into the RESI through either `INPUT 7` or `INPUT 8`.
  Any HDMI cable can be used route the feed.

### HDMI Input 

  This is for video capture and recording.
  Use the Video Capture USB dongle.
  Record use [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) which should already be installed on the MacBook.
  Plug into `PROGRAM OUT`.
  Confirm `PROGRAM OUT` is working, as it has not been working previously.
  If `PROGRAM OUT` is not working, plug into `AUX OUT` instead.
  From the RESI settings, go to the `AUX` menu, and set `source` to `PROGRAM`.

### Audio output

  Videos played on the MacBook send audio to the audio cart via the 3.5mm male TRS audio cable coming from the audio cart.

## RESI

### Lyrics
  Set DSK1 (down stream key 1) cut and fill to either `INPUT 7` or `INPUT 8`, whichever has the feed for lyrics (lower-third).
  See the red highlight, if you want to use the buttons to set the sources.

  See the next picture, if you want to use the `Downstream Key 1` menu to set the sources.

### Picture in Picture 
  Hitting one of the PIP buttons (see the yellow highlight) displays the PIP in preview and “ties” it to the next transition.
  To remove PIP, hit the “Background” button (see the purple highlight), while the PIP is in `Preview`.
  :warning: **Hitting the “Background” button while the PIP is in `Program` causes strange behavior.**
  **Transition to `Preview` first!**
  ![RESI PIP Buttons](/images/RESI/front_pip_buttons.jpg)

  The buttons, with “tie” in them, ties that setting to the next transition.
  Transitions cycle between `Preview` and `Program`.
  Any tied setting will display in `Preview` (or `Program` depending on if it's live or not) before the transition.

## Audio

//TODO: Depict “channels” on the board and how they correspond to the audio cart snake.
